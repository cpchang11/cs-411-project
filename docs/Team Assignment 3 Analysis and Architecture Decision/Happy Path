Happy Path:

1. The user will hit the login button in the corner which will make a pop-up appear to login through facebook.
2. The user will enter their username and password 
3. The pop-up disappers and they will be logged in.

Sad Path:
1a. The user selects the register button if they are a new user
1b. An error message appears in the pop up that says the username or password doesn't match. 
2. The user selects a forgot password button to reset their password through an 
email they recieve from facebook
