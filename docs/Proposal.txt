Idea #1:

A website that once a list of ingredients are inputed, it will output
recipes from Food API that contain those ingredients. Also, it will provide a Spotify
playlist using Spotify's API with music that suits the country of origin for your dish. 
Users would sign in using Facebook and would be able to save all recipes 
that they like in a database, as well as save what ingredients they didn't 
use so that they don't have to reenter them for next time.

Idea #2:

A website that would uses Yelp's API to give you the shortest wait times from 
restaurants in the area and then would order you an Uber using their API to go to the restaurant you choose.
Users would sign in using Facebook and save all restaraunts that they liked in a database.
