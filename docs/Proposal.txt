Idea #1:

A website that once a list of ingredients in input, it will output
recipes that contain those ingredients. Also it will provide a Spotify
playlist with music that suits the country of origin for your dish.

Idea #2:

A website that would give you the shortest waittimes from a list of restaurants and then would order you an uber to that restaurant.
