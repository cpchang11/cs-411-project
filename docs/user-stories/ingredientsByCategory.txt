Another way our users would be able to add ingredients on the app would be via
categories. There would be a list of drop down boxes, each by different categories
such as poultry, pork, fruit, spices, baking, etc. Also there would be categories
for different dietary restrictions such as Vegan, Vegetarian, Pescatarian etc.

Once a drop down would be clicked, each would have common items that fall under that
category. So for fruit, there would be options like apple, pear, grapes etc. To
find items under categories easier, there would also be a search box to refine your
search.
