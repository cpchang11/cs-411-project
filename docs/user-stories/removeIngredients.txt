A user could manually remove ingredients from the app. They would be able to access
all their ingredients, and either by search or by category they could see their ingredients.
They would click a "remove" toggle, which would enable the user to remove ingredients
when they click them. Then, once they found the ingredient they want to remove,
they could simply click them and they would be removed from their list of ingredients.
