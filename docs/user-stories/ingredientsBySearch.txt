One way a user would be able to add ingredients on the web app is via a search.
There would be a standard search box, where the user would click it and type
in their desired ingredient. By relevance, the app would suggest ingredients based
off what the user is typing, so if they were typing in "chick", the search would
recommend possible ingredients like "chicken breast, chicken thigh, chicken
wings etc."
