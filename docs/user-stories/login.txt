User Story Login

The user will hit the login button in the corner which will make a pop-up appear to login through facebook.
The user will enter their username and password and if they successfully type it in, the pop-up disappers 
and they will be logged in. If not, an error message will appear in the pop up that says the username or 
password doesn't match. The user will be able to select a forgot password button to reset their password through an 
email they recieve from facebook and a register button if they are a new user.
