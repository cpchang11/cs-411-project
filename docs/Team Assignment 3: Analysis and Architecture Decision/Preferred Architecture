We plan on using Node.js to develop our solution in. Our team is rather familiar with JavaScript and as a result it would be easier for us to move forward with that. 
At the same time, it is easy to find documentation online in case we ever get stuck. A lack of experience also plays a large role in our decision not to use another framework,
Flask. That lack of experience with Flask combined with the fact that we have experience in JavaScript (as well as lots of online documentation) is our main reason for moving forward
with Node.js and not with Flask.
